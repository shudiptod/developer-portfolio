            <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born
                and I
                will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer
                of
                the
                truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
                because
                it is
                pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences
                that
                are
                extremely painful.</p>
